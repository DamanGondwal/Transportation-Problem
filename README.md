# Transportation-Problem
a classic operations research and linear programming problem used to minimize transportation cost while meeting supply and demand constraints.



The workbook is organized into four sheets:

Dataset (Case 1)
Contains the transportation cost matrix between supply locations and demand locations

Displays available supply at each origin and required demand at each destination

Serves as the input data for Case 1

**Solution of Case 1**

Shows the optimal shipment allocation

Demonstrates how supply is distributed to meet demand at minimum cost

Includes calculated totals for verification

Dataset (Case 2)

A second transportation scenario with different cost, supply, and demand values

Designed to illustrate how changes in inputs affect the optimal solution

**Solution of Case 2**

Optimal allocation corresponding to Dataset (Case 2)

Confirms feasibility and cost minimization under new constraints

**Problem Concept**

The transportation problem aims to:

Minimize total transportation cost

Ensure that:

Total shipments from each source do not exceed its supply

Total shipments to each destination satisfy its demand

**This model is commonly used in:**

Supply chain and logistics planning

Warehouse-to-market allocation

Cost optimization in distribution networks
